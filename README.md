# Host A blog Without A Backend

> **Note:** This demo is a part of my [blog post that I published on medium.com](#). For information about what this is kindly go to my blog where I explained all this in detail.

The main idea here is that I am using `showdown.js` to convert markdown content into pure, renderable HTML content. As for the Markdown content you see below, I am getting it from github raw URLs. These are special URLs which start like this `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`
