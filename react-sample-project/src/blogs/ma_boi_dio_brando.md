Dio Brando (`ディオ・ブランドー` Dio Burandō), known as DIO (ディオ) from Part 3 onwards, is the main antagonist in the original universe of [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure), featured primarily as the main antagonist in [Phantom Blood](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Blood) and [Stardust Crusaders](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Stardust_Crusaders), and a posthumous key antagonist in [Stone Ocean](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_Ocean).

After becoming a [Vampire](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire) and later a [Stand](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Stand) user, DIO has gathered around him many minions and is responsible for many major events of the series, from the death of [Jonathan Joestar](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Jonathan_Joestar) to the Joestar Family's sudden acquisition of Stand power, and his legacy persists throughout the series. He is the wielder of the immensely powerful [The World](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/The_World).

DIO is the father of [Giorno Giovanna](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Giorno_Giovanna), the main protagonist of Part 5, as well as a handful of other illegitimate offspring.
